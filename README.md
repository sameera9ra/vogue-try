- User inputs: photo, outfit type, style preference
- Prototype interface using Streamlit
- Safe handling of user images

## Daily Progress

### Day 1 — Ideation & Conceptualization 🚀
Super excited to kick off my project for the 8‑Day AI Application Challenge — **Vogue Try**.  
It’s a generative AI–based virtual try-on app designed to help users see how clothes will look on them before buying online.  
Try outfits virtually, reduce uncertainty in online shopping, and make fashion decisions easier and more fun! 🛍️🤖

### Day 2 — Data / Knowledge Sources Inventory 📊
Focused on identifying and organizing the data sources for the app: user images, clothing catalog images, style preferences, and synthetic demo datasets.  
Planned preprocessing, input validation, and safe handling of PII for all user data.

### Day 3 — Building the Intelligence Behind Vogue Try 🧠
Worked on the core logic of Vogue Try, defining the virtual try-on workflow and AI reasoning.  
Identified key user inputs (body type, outfit selection, style preferences) and created the initial conceptual flow of outfit previews.
